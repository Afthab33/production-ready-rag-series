Hereâ€™s a **structured curriculum** for your LinkedIn series + Google Colab project, organized into **modules** based on the topics you've shared. This roadmap is designed to gradually build RAG expertise, combining core concepts with practical LangChain implementations:

---

## ðŸ“˜ RAG Curriculum for LinkedIn Series + Google Colab Labs

---

### âœ… **Module 1: Retrieval Fundamentals**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

Keyword Search (BM25)

Semantic Search

Hybrid Search (Dense + Sparse)

Intro to Vector Databases

What is a vector DB?

Why not use traditional DBs?

Key features: similarity search, metadata filtering, upserts

Top vector DBs: FAISS (local), Pinecone (hosted), Weaviate (self-hosted), Qdrant, Chroma



**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Implement BM25 with `Elasticsearch` or `Haystack`
* Implement Dense Search with `FAISS` + `OpenAI/HuggingFace Embeddings`
* Combine both for Hybrid Retrieval using `LangChain` retriever wrappers

---

### âœ… **Module 2: Evaluating Retrieval Effectiveness**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* Retrieval Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1
* Ranking Metrics: MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), NDCG, R\@k
* Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
* Score-based vs Rank-based fusion
* Qualitative vs Quantitative evaluation

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Evaluate top-k retrieval from multiple methods
* Plot metrics using `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
* Implement RRF and compare with baseline retrievers

---

### âœ… **Module 3: Chunking Strategies**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* Why Chunking is needed
* Fixed-length vs Overlapping Chunks
* Metadata-aware chunking

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Implement recursive text splitter in LangChain
* Visualize chunk distribution from long documents
* Store chunks in vector DB with metadata

---

### âœ… **Module 4: Advanced Chunking & Retrieval Techniques**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* Advanced Chunking Techniques (semantic chunking, overlap tuning)
* Query Parsing
* Cross-Encoders vs Bi-Encoders
* ColBERT and Token-level scoring
* Reranking with LLMs

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Apply semantic-aware chunking
* Implement Cross-Encoder reranking using HuggingFace
* Use LLM reranker (OpenAI, Cohere) to rerank top-k results

---

### âœ… **Module 5: LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* Transformer Architecture (brief explainer)
* LLM Sampling Strategies (Top-k, Top-p)
* Choosing your LLM (OpenAI, Claude, Cohere)
* Prompt Engineering (basic & advanced)
* Handling Hallucinations
* RAG vs Fine-tuning

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Construct prompts with retrieved context (stuff, map-reduce)
* Compare outputs from different prompt strategies
* Show examples of hallucinations and how grounding helps

---

### âœ… **Module 6: Evaluation, Logging & Observability**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* Challenges in production RAG systems
* Logging retrieval + generation
* Monitoring latency, cost, and quality
* Tracing LLM workflows
* Custom RAG evaluation metrics

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Add logging using LangChain callbacks
* Log context, prompt, response, latency, and cost
* Visualize retrieval vs generation latency trade-offs

---

### âœ… **Module 7: Optimization & Deployment**

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* Quantization for LLMs
* Cost vs Quality trade-offs
* Latency optimization techniques
* Security concerns in RAG systems
* Multimodal RAG (text + images)

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Use smaller quantized models (e.g., GGUF, GPTQ) locally
* Evaluate latency/cost per model call
* Simulate multimodal RAG (e.g., captioning + retrieval)

---

### âš¡ Bonus Module (Optional): Agentic RAG

**ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:**

* RAG Agents with tools
* Agent memory & long-term context
* Routing queries to specialized tools

**ðŸ§ª Google Colab Lab:**

* Build a simple `ConversationalRetrievalChain`
* Add tool-calling agent that searches, generates, and answers
